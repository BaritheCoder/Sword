# Sword
Hello! This is a project i am making for a Bulgarian competetion with my frined. It is going to be a 3d printed sword with an esp 32 as the microcontroller, an mp 6050 as the gyroscope, a 1000 mah battery a tp4056 and an mt 3608 module for the power.

So I started doing the 3d modelling and made the overall shape of the sword first, the way everything is going to be fixed together and split the blade so it can fit on my printer

Then I made a slot for the power boards in the handle

I made a simple tray that inserts in the handle to give me better acces to the components while assembling it.

And that is pretty much it from the Cad designs. I know it may not be the best design but I spent quite a lot of time on it and after all i need it to work for just a few minutes while presenting it. If you want to print it/ make your own version of it ill leave the stl and step files.

I made a simple wiring diagram:
